This project uses advanced data mining methods on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset (569 samples, 30 features) to find patterns that can be used to classify tumors.  The whole process is covered, including cleaning the data, feature engineering, regression, classification, clustering (K-Means and K-Medoids), outliers, K-Means and K-Medoids, and association rule mining.  Some important insights are strong signs of cancer (for example, the worst concave points and the mean radius) and a lot of different features that can relate to each other. This helps make strong modeling decisions.  This work shows how to make decisions based on data in healthcare diagnostics from start to finish using Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebooks.
